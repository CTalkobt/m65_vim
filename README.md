# m65_vim
Tiny vim for M65 

THIS IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT. DON'T EXPECT MUCH AT PRESENT. 

Now that the screaming is out of the way: 
- This project relies upon the latest changes I've made to Oscar64 to have it support the Mega65. As such, you'll probably also want to check out my Oscar64 branch.



Setup:
-------
Clone the project with --recurse-submodules

Note:Currently the oscar65 build errors on one of the tests. This can be ignored and is a problem with the upstream oscar64.
