Coding conventions: 
===================

Prefixes: 
--------------------
t  - typedef
s  - struct
p  - pointer
p2 - Double pointer
z  - Null terminated string (typically auto allocated)
pz - Null terminated string, 
i  - Integer
c  - Character
u  - Unsigned. 

Notes: 
------
Prefixes may be skipped if the name of the variable clearly indicates it's type. 

Naming conventions in code my differ from above as it's been a bit of time, since I've coded in C. This type convention is "old memory" and I'll make changes to correct in time - I may not be consistant as I add / alter code.
