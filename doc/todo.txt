Initial Target Release (0.5)
=============================
- Minimal command set to implement basic movement, navigation within a file, basic viewing and reading (:r) of a file. 
- There will initially not be : 
  - No support for insertion or modification of text. 
  - Numeric default mode command support.  (eg, 5dd to delete 5 lines). 
  - No Command mode commands other than :r and :w to read and write the file. 
  
To-Do:
-------------------
These items are intended for the next release. 

- Determine internal storage for file contents.
  - C alloc via lines. 
  - C allow via block memory. 
  - C alloc via memory segments. 
  - Line pointer references into memory block. 
  - Should files be "padded" to allow for changes to not force reallocation constantly? 

- Line movement 

- Initial file load and display (perhaps hardcoded filename for testing)
